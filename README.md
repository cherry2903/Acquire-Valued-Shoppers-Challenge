# Acquire-Valued-Shoppers-Challenge

Consumer brands often offer discounts to attract new shoppers to buy their products. The most valuable customers are those who return after this initial incented purchase.  With enough purchase history, it is possible to predict which shoppers, when presented an offer, will buy a new item. However, identifying the shopper who will become a loyal buyer -- prior to the initial purchase -- is a more challenging task.

The Acquire Valued Shoppers Challenge asks participants to predict which shoppers are most likely to repeat purchase. To aid with algorithmic development, we have provided complete, basket-level, pre-offer shopping history for a large set of shoppers who were targeted for an acquisition campaign. The incentive offered to that shopper and their post-incentive behavior is also provided.

This data has almost 350 million rows of completely anonymised transactional data from over 300,000 shoppers.
